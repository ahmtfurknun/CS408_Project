# Quiz-Game-Socket-Programming

This socket programming project presents a client-server application for conducting a simple quiz game. The project consists of two integral components - the server module and the player module. The server acts as the central facilitator in handling incoming connections, posing questions, and maintaining an accurate record of the scores throughout the game. On the other hand, the player module allows players to enroll and participate in the quiz game by answering the questions posed by the server.

To ensure transparency and accountability, the server broadcasts the results and overall score table after each question. This allows players to keep track of their progress in the game and to gauge their performance relative to other players. The server also ensures secure communication between the players and ensures that all questions and answers are accurately transmitted.

The player module has been designed with the end-user in mind and is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Players only need to enroll in the quiz game and start participating immediately. After each question, the player module displays the results and overall score table, thus allowing players to monitor their progress throughout the game.

This project utilizes socket programming to achieve efficient communication between the server and players, enabling the game to be played over a network. This means that players can participate from different locations, adding a new dimension to the game.

In conclusion, this project provides an entertaining and educational platform for players to test their knowledge and compete with others. The server module guarantees the smooth and fair conduct of the game, while the player module offers a convenient and accessible way for players to participate.
